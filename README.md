# FaceSecure-Real-Time-Face-Recognition-with-OpenCV
Built a real-time face recognition system using OpenCV and deep learning techniques to detect and recognize faces from live webcam input. The project applies feature encoding and comparison for identity verification, demonstrating practical skills in computer vision, Python, and facial recognition libraries.
